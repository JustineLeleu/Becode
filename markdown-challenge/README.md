## You can always count on me when...
In case of a problem, I am very patient and could spend a few hours trying to fix it without too much screaming.

## A funny story
When I was a kid in kindergarten during the gym class we were playing catch or something like that. At one point another kid pushed me with a little too much strength and I fell head first on the tiled floor. I lost my two front teeth and they could not put them back at the hospital because my teachers forgot to give them to my parents. So I spend a few years with a big hole between my teeth waiting for them to grow back.

### TL;DR
I lost my two front teeth during a gym class in kindergarten.
