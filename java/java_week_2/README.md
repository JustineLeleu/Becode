# java_week_2

### Goals for Week 2

- Understand and use the static keyword for implementing the singleton pattern.
- Use the final keyword correctly to make variables, methods, or classes immutable or unchangeable.
- Learn and utilize enumerations to represent predefined sets of named constants.
- Get comfortable working with nested collections, such as lists of lists or maps of lists.
- Write generic code, including implementing your own Stack data structure.
- Write functions and functional interfaces using lambda expressions.
- Read and write lambdas, understanding their anonymous function nature and potential impact on readability.
- Utilize the Java 8 streaming API for operations like map, reduce, and collect, using lambdas.
- Understand closures in Java, which allow lambdas to access variables from their enclosing scope.
- Gain a comprehensive understanding of types as abstractions that define object behavior.
- Work with Optionals to handle null values and ensure code robustness.
