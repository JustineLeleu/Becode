            <h2>A funny story</h2>
            <p class="text">When I was a kid in kindergarten during the gym class we were playing catch or something like that. At one point another kid pushed me with a little too much strength and I fell head first on the tiled floor. I lost my two front teeth and they could not put them back at the hospital because my teachers forgot to give them to my parents. So I spend a few years with a big hole between my teeth waiting for them to grow back.</p>
            <h3>TL;DR</h3>
